# R&D Test / Reliability Engineer
*This portfolio presents selected engineering projects focused on reliability testing, experimental validation, and data-driven failure investigation of electromechanical systems.*

## Project: Early-Stage Reliability & Testability Planning for a Multimodal Electromechanical System
**Role:** Electrical Engineer (Exploratory / Pre-Implementation)
### Project Context
Astral AR is an early-stage effort exploring a multimodal electromechanical sensing concept. At the time of my involvement, the system was in the conceptual and feasibility phase, with limited hardware implementation and no production or field data available.

The primary objective was to reason about system structure, interfaces, and observability early enough to avoid downstream reliability and integration issues.

### My Role

- Contributed to **system decomposition** and interface definition across electrical, sensing, and mechanical subsystems
- Focused on **testability, observability, and reliability risk identification** rather than execution of validation testing
- Produced **hardware and subsystem block diagrams** to support future test planning and integration
- Documented assumptions, open risks, and candidate validation approaches for downstream development

### Technical Challenges

- No mature hardware or field failures to analyze
- High uncertainty around timing behavior, environmental sensitivity, and cross-subsystem interactions
- Need to reason about **potential reliability risks without empirical data**

### Approach

- Performed **early-stage reliability risk identification** by analyzing signal paths, power dependencies, and interface boundaries
- Evaluated where **timing drift, environmental sensitivity, or observability gaps** were likely to emerge once hardware existed
- Assessed which risks would be testable with instrumentation versus those requiring architectural mitigation
- Framed candidate validation strategies without implying execution or closure

### Outcomes

- Clear documentation of **reliability-relevant risks and assumptions**
- Testability-informed subsystem diagrams suitable for future DVT and characterization work
- A structured foundation enabling downstream engineers to design validation tests with fewer blind spots
